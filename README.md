# Automated Penetration Testing Tool

This Python script provides a comprehensive automated penetration testing tool for performing various security assessments and tests on a target system or network. It leverages popular tools and techniques commonly used in penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities, exploit them, and assess overall security posture.

# Features: ..

```
Network Scanning: Scan the target network to identify active hosts and their open ports.

Service Enumeration: Enumerate services running on target systems to gather detailed information.

Vulnerability Exploitation: Exploit known vulnerabilities in target systems to gain unauthorized access.

Privilege Escalation: Attempt to escalate privileges on compromised systems to gain higher-level access.

Credential Extraction: Extract credentials from compromised systems for further exploitation.

Report Generation: Generate comprehensive reports summarizing the results of the penetration testing activities.

Interactive Shell: Open an interactive shell for further exploration and exploitation.

Web Application Testing: Perform security assessments on web applications to identify vulnerabilities.

Password Cracking: Attempt to crack passwords using various techniques and tools.

Wireless Network Testing: Conduct security assessments on wireless networks to identify weaknesses.

File Integrity Checking: Check the integrity of critical system files to detect unauthorized changes.

Exploit Database Search: Search for known exploits in popular exploit databases for targeted attacks.

Temporary Files Cleanup: Clean up temporary files generated during penetration testing activities.
```
#  Usage

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Configure the config.ini file with appropriate settings for your environment.
Run the script using python automated_penetration_testing_tool.py.
Follow the on-screen menu to choose the desired penetration testing actions.

# Configuration

```The config.ini file contains configuration settings for the penetration testing tool, including target IP addresses, network ranges, tool paths, and logging preferences. Adjust these settings according to your specific testing requirements.```

#  Logging

The script uses logging to record important events and errors during the penetration testing process. You can configure the logging level and format in the config.ini file to suit your preferences.
